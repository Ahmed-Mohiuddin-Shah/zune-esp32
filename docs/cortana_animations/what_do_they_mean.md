# Cortana – All Animations List & What They Mean

1. **Calm** – The instance in which she has a still-two halo appearance. The outside halo being lighter than the inside one.

2. **Optimistic v.1** – The instance where her still-two halo appearance breaks apart and semi-rotates.

3. **Reminder** – The instance where her two halos change shape. The outer halo becomes larger and thicker while pulsating.

4. **Excitement** – The instance where the two halos go through a flipped rotation. Usually occurring upon greeting or search queries.

5. **Sensitive (slightly)** – The instance in which her halos rotate in size. Usually denoting her apprehension to a question.

6. **Abashed** – The instance in which her halos rotate up and down simultaneously. This happens usually when she’s more embarrassed for you than herself (not in a judging manner).

7. **Alert** – The instance when her outer halo is enlarged, darker, and pulsating. Very similar to a reminder.

8. **Bouncy** – One of the more visually distinct appearances. Her outer halo breaks into four separate 1/4 circles and rotates around the inner halo. This usually denotes a playful Cortana.

9. **Still thinking** – The instance when her halos rotate continuously while she searches or awaits further input information.

10. **Elated** – The instance in which her inner halo is narrowed slightly at the top. This animation usually occurs when she’s successfully found something.

11. **Satisfied** – The instance in which her two halos go through a series of all-encompassing rotations. A splash of optimistic, sensitive (slightly), and excitement.

12. **Considerate** – The instance in which her halos look pretty much the same as optimistic v.1.

13. **Music listening** – The instance when her halos switch size from large to small simultaneously as they pulsate to the sound of music.

14. **Optimistic v.2** – Another visually distinct appearance. Cortana’s inner halo pulsates more rapidly while the outer halo becomes thinner.

15. **Actively listening** – The instance in which her halos slowly pulsate.

16. **Sensitive v.2** – The instance in which her halos look similar to sensitive v.1 but are more narrowed.
    ![Sensitive v.2](images/sensitive_v2.png)
17. **Speaking** – This animation is indicative of her active participation. The halos look very similar (if not identical) to when she is reminding or listening.

18. **Thinking v.2** – This animation is her caught in thought, or perhaps needing more input.
